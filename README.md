## [ ⚠️ ] Before you'll put this script on Auto-Execute, you must be aware of bloats/overflows this script can cause. Bloats/overflows can extend from several kilobytes to a few gigabytes. Always remember to clean the "LoggedOutputs" folder in the Workspace folder.

This script automatically logs all output messages for you in every single Roblox game and server!

All files with logged outputs go into the "LoggedOutputs" folder under the Workspace folder.
Names of the log files have roblox place's IDs and roblox server's Job-IDs.

**In order to execute this script**
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/IvanTheProtogen/OutputLogger/raw/main/main.lua"))();
```
